# Engage
An iPad web app that mimics a restaurant that leads cheekily into a proposal (for free!)

## Screen Detail

1.html - This is the welcome screen that sets the stage. Change the .mp4 with your voice for added kudos.
2.html - The 'Brief History' section. Add in just enough detail about your relationship to get the ball rolling yet not be too obvious.
3.html - A few marriage wines are listed, time to get creative if you like. Include some good descriptions of wines you two enjoy.
4.html - The appetizer section. Update with appetizers you two have enjoyed over the course of your relationship, along with a few of the current restaurant.
5.html - The proposal! Edit the google maps URL by going to Google Maps > entering in the restaurant > Click 'Share' > Select 'Embed Map' and use that URL.
6.html - Your hard work paid off. Celebrate!

## Up and running

1. Edit the HTML and CSS files to suit your needs.
2. Create an AWS S3 bucket and upload the Engage folder.
3. Make the files publicly accessible by following the tutorials for a static website.
4. Navigate to the URL on your iPad and save the page to your home screen.
5. Select the newly saved icon and the web app will display without tabs/url and in portrait mode.
6. Start 'Guided Access Mode' by clicking the home button three times (this disables the user from exiting out of the app.)
	
## During Development (a helper)

1. Open Google Chrome and access the developer tools (f12)
2. Click 'toggle device toolbar'
3. Select 'iPad'

This allows the developer the ability to mimic what it will look and act like on the iPad. Always test afterwards!

## Limitations

1. You MUST have an internet connection.

When I asked my (now) fiance, I turned on the hotspot on my phone and connected the iPad ;) Worked out great!
